## SoundWaves

SoundWaves, a fork of [Hapi Podcast] [play],
an Android app for playing and managing and syncing your podcasts.

I started this project because the Android echosystem seriously lacked a
pro-user podcast app. This app is trying to be the good guy by:

* Being released as free and open source software
* Being free of cost
* Privacy aware
* Cloud based and multi device friendly
* User friendly 

This git repository includes the full history that is available in the
Hapi Podcast [svn repository] [svnrepo].

  [play]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.bottiger.podcast
  [gitrepo]: https://github.com/bottiger/SoundWaves

It has a few new features and a rearranged UI.

Thanks a ton to xuluan for making this open-source podcaster and helping me
get started with my own fork.
