## HapiPodcastJ

This is HapiPodcastJ, a fork of [Hapi Podcast] [play],
an Android app for playing podcasts.

This git repository includes the full history that is available in the
Hapi Podcast [svn repository] [svnrepo].

  [play]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.xuluan.podcast
  [svnrepo]: http://code.google.com/p/hapiboke/

It has a few new features and a rearranged UI.

Thanks a ton to xuluan for making this open-source podcaster and helping me
get started with my own fork.
